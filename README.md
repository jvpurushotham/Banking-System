Project Title:
Bank Management System

Description:
This Bank Management System is a C++ console-based application that simulates core banking operations. It allows users to create and manage bank accounts with features for depositing, withdrawing, and viewing account details. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation and dynamic memory management, to build a simple yet functional banking solution.

Features:

Account Creation: Create a bank account with a unique account number, account holder name, and an initial balance.
Deposit Funds: Add money to an existing account and view the updated balance.
Withdraw Funds: Withdraw money with checks for sufficient balance.
Display Account Details: View the account holder's name, account number, and balance.
Interactive Menu System: Navigate through various banking operations easily.
Technologies Used:

Language: C++
Data Structure: std::vector for dynamic account storage
Key Concepts:

Object-Oriented Programming: Classes for BankAccount and Bank encapsulate data and behavior.
Input Validation: Ensures only valid deposits and withdrawals.
Dynamic Data Management: Supports multiple accounts with efficient search functionality.
Future Enhancements:

Implement account security with passwords.
Add transaction history and interest calculation features.
